# Project Summary:

This is a project for practicing theories and methodologies leanrt from Telling Story with Data class. This file recorded the journey of how I make proposal, do initial sketching, draw outline, do audience test and finish the visualization.
> NOTE:After part I and II, I changed my topic because of the limit of my data source and topic scope. It is also a notable lesson learnt form the practice. 


# Part I
## Outline
* Summary
This story is about crimes occured around CMU community in last two years. It is based on the data extacted from safety alter emails (from campuspd@andrew.cmu.edu) and CMU annual safety report. By depicting features of these incidence, it can help students in our community identify the time periods and locations at higher risk.
* Structure
1.summary：We will start by a data map showing the overall geographical distribution of the incidents. 
> With icons representing categories, gender, season, time of different cases.
2.time period distribution：
> Time period
Don't go outside during...
1) day time
2) season
3) annual

3. Victim Profile:
> If you are this kind of person, Be Careful!
1) gender
2) age group
3) habit

4. Criminal Profile:
>If you see this kind of guys aroung!
1) age group
2) appearance
3) categories

5.CMU policies

6.Call to action:
> Stay alert to your surroundings at all times.
Use the University Shuttle/Escort Service when possible.
Report any suspicious incidents, persons or vehicles to CMU Police at 412-268-2323, or off campus to the Pittsburgh Police at 911.
Do not approach suspicious persons or vehicles.
Stay close to friends and do not interact with strangers.

## Data
This is the data used:
[DATA table](/CMUAlert.xlsx)

The data is extacted by myself from safety alter emails (from campuspd@andrew.cmu.edu) and CMU 2019 annual safety report.
I looked up the longitude and latitude of the incidents from google earth. So that i can use R to make a data map.
I also recorded victim information, time ,criminal information. I can use tableau to make charts to show their features.

## Method

I plan to use shorthand for the story structure. That will be like https://preview.shorthand.com/DkybT0IpGUDm7wPz.
For data analytics, I will make map by R and tableau.

## Oops, Topic Change


After Part II, I found two fatal flaws of my topic. 1. The scope was too narrow to form a interesting story. 2. The data table I made by my own was too thin to support an inspiring exploration. And the grographic information i collected was not detailed enough to draw the location map. Then i decided to change my topic.
> Lesson learnt: 1. The scope of your topic matters when you want to get insights from data. 2. Base your story on solid, accurate and detailed data. Data source is really important. 

## New topic and some repeating work
* Summary:
Since I am a super fan of Pokemon video games and animes, I want to tell a story of this virtual world but based on real world data. I want to tell a story of how to be a good player in pokemon games. Pokemon is an global virtual IP origined from 1995. This scope is really a big one. I used tableau to do the data visualization, used shorthand to organize the story.
* Data:
I found the data from https://data.world/ljvmiranda921/pokemon-go-dataset/workspace/file?filename=pkmn-go.csv
https://data.world/data-society/pokemon-with-stats
https://data.world/data-society/pokemon-with-stats/workspace/file?filename=Pokemon.csv. They are originally from player community and Pokemon GO offical website. This time, the data is pretty solid, covering attributes, player modes, demograohic facts about thousands of pokemons. 
* Audience Finding:
My audience will be people interested in pokemon games or freshman just start playing it.
I interview 3 friends about my idea and what data they want to know under this topic. The top three they mentioned are: Basic rule, Fighting system, Basic attributes freshman need to now.
Then I interviewed three active players on a big player bbs: https://bbs.nga.cn/thread.php?fid=529&rand=82 (it's a chinese bbs) by " private conversation ". I requested them to give me some advice on organizing the story from a player perspective.
Surprisingly ,two of them mentioned pokeball as the second necessity for freshmen. 
* data visulization:
I used tableau for visualization. The most interesting skill i learnt from it is customizing the icons in scatterplots or maps.

# Part IV: 

I also did a presentation with the same link https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/tiangey/index.html. 

Thanks for your time.
