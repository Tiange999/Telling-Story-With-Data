This story is about crimes occured around CMU community in last two years. It is based on the data extacted from safety alter emails (from campuspd@andrew.cmu.edu) and CMU annual safety report. By depicting features of these incidence, it can help students in our community identify the time periods and locations at higher risk.

## Data
This is the data used:
[DATA table](/CMUAlert.xlsx)

The data is extacted by myself from safety alter emails (from campuspd@andrew.cmu.edu) and CMU 2019 annual safety report.
I looked up the longitude and latitude of the incidents from google earth. So that i can use R to make a data map.
I also recorded victim information, time ,criminal information. I can use tableau to make charts to show their features.

## Method

I plan to use shorthand for the story structure. That will be like https://preview.shorthand.com/DkybT0IpGUDm7wPz.
For data analytics, I will make map by R and tableau.
