# About me
I am a 2nd year CMU MSPPM student in the Telling Story With Data (94870) course. I am a addicted video game player, a serious drawing amateur, a diary keeper, a 'outfit of the day' thinker. I am still considering my next episode after grad. 

# My vision for this class
I hope to become a creative data visualization designer after taking this course. I can do sketching, I know how adobe design tools works, I know how to use R and R shiny to do visualization. But I hardly know how to be creative about data.
